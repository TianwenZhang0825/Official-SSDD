**【SL-SSDD】**

SL-SSDD: Sea-Land Segmentation Dataset for SSDD
SL-SSDD is the first synergistic sea-land segmentation dataset tailored for deep learning-based SAR ship detection, built upon the well-established SAR Ship Detection Dataset (SSDD). It addresses the critical gap of lacking sea-land prior information in existing SAR ship detection datasets, enabling models to fully distinguish between sea and land regions for more accurate detection.
